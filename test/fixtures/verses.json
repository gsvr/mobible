        "verse": "While Jesus was eating with his disciples, Jesus took a piece of bread, gave a prayer of thanks, broke it in pieces, and gave it to his disciples. â€œTake and eat it,â€ he said; â€œthis is my body.â€  Then he took a cup, gave thanks to God, and gave it to them. â€œDrink it, all of you,â€ he said; â€œthis is my blood, which seals God's covenant, my blood poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.  I tell you, I will never again drink this wine until the day I drink the new wine with you in my Father's Kingdom.â€  Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives."
